I heard about Fontaines D.C. while I was in Galway at a Lightning Bolt concert at Roisin Dubh. A very tall Finnish guy asked me what Irish bands I liked. I told him about The Frames, and he asked if I knew Fontaines D.C. 

They are a new post punk band from Dublin, whose front man, Grian Chatten speaks more than sings his lyrics over a grungy, slightly noisy instrumental accompaniment. He sings with a thick Irish accent rather than masking it. His voice reminds me of Art Brut. He suffers no illusions of having singing abilities, and it frees him up to be expressive in the way he knows best. The real strength of this band are the lyrics. They are honest and raw, but also poetic and artful.

They just released a new album called Skinty Fia, and I can't get enough of it. Their first album, Dogrel, appeals to my teenage self, but Skinty Fia is musically and lyrically more mature.

**Update 10-24-2022**: I found out they have a third full-length album, _A Hero's Death (2020)_. I also saw them in concert on September 20th at Toole 191, Tucson with a band called Wunderhorse. They exceeded my expectations for a live performance. Grian Chatten was transporting -- the way he paced the stage as if he were thinking of what to say next in an argument, then manhandle the mic and belt out the next verse. His movements were jerky and frenetic, and their playing was perfect. The floor was crowded, but I was pretty close, only about 4 rows back, and I had made a new friend to enjoy the show with. I'm so glad I got to see them in a smaller venue. They'll be opening for Arctic Monkeys at the Armory in March or so, but I don't think it'll be worth the money and huge crowd. I'll wait until they come out with a new album and maybe see them again then.
