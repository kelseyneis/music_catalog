I found Oisin Mod through seeing them [in concert](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/oisin-mod-tickets-349652228227) for their debut album release in Galway at An Taibhdhearc - National Irish language theatre on August 12, 2022. I was late coming from a social event for the summer school I was attending and didn't realize it was a sit down concert. They let me in between songs, and thankfully I only missed about the first 15 minutes.

They have a slightly Beatles feel, especially in the song, Honeycomb. They were very at home on stage and had a relaxed interaction with the audience, who adored them.
