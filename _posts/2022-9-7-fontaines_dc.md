I heard about Fontaines D.C. while I was in Galway at a Lightning Bolt concert at Roisin Dubh. A very tall Finnish guy asked me what Irish bands I liked. I told him about The Frames, and he asked if I knew Fontaines D.C. 

They are a new post punk band from Dublin, whose front man, Grian Chatten speaks more than sings his lyrics over a grungy, slightly noisy instrumental accompaniment. He sings with a thick Irish accent rather than masking it. His voice reminds me of Art Brut. He suffers no illusions of having singing abilities, and it frees him up to be expressive in the way he knows best. The real strength of this band are the lyrics. They are honest and raw, but also poetic and artful.

They just released a new album called Skinty Fia, and I can't get enough of it. Their first album, Dogrel, appeals to my teenage self, but Skinty Fia is musically and lyrically more mature.
