I found Lightning Bolt when I was in Galway, Ireland. They played at Róisín Dubh with the Belfast opening band, Enola Gay. I was there with a group from the ESSLLI summer school. After the opening band finished, someone pointed out the drumset on the floor at the opposite wall from the stage and said they were going to play there. I thought he was joking at first. Now I know this is called a [mop bucket performance](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChXipNiJk3V/).

And it was the best concert I've ever been to. There weren't too many people in the small venue, and we huddled around the two performers. The drummer, Brian Chippendale wore a gory mask and asked the crowd a question. When someone shouted back, he said something along the lines of, "that's how I know who I need to watch out for". It was funny -- I wish I could remember the exact exchange. That was the moment I knew it was going to be a good time.

Before seeing them live, I only sort of enjoyed their music. I had found the event on [This is Galway](https://thisisgalway.ie/) and checked out [Sonic Citadel](https://lightningbolt.bandcamp.com/album/sonic-citadel). I found it a bit too heavy. Seeing them live changed that. Their music is wild and full of electric energy. The drums were fast paced and chaotic. Eventually I joined the mosh pit and started really getting into it. By the end, I felt like I had just had really good sex.

I'm going to be watching their [site](https://www.thrilljockey.com/artists/lightning-bolt) like a hawk for upcoming concerts now, although it won't be the same as in Galway, because they don't often get to do these mop bucket performances. I'll need to find places where they're not so popular.
