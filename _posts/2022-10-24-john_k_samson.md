I found the band, The Weakerthans awhile back through Spotify recommending the song, "Plea From a Cat Named Virtute". I was immediately struck by how clever, yet poignant the lyrics were. It's written from a cat's perspective, trying to get its owner to snap out of his funk. So, when I discovered John Samson's solo work, I was not surprised to find the lyrics even more satisfying. His full-length album, _Winter Wheat_ (2016), exhibits his talent for lyricism and melodies and vocals that complement them well.

What is so lovely about his lyrics, and about any good writing in my opinion, is how they find a perfect level of description and use unique examples to illustrate the emotion in his songs. For example, in the song "Oldest Oak at Brookside", which is about an old tree, rather than saying it's older than the Internet and you and me, or some other cliche, he uses examples like, "before we built that smirking airport" and "before the taste of Malathion lingered here". The specificity and beauty of his examples draw you in before ending on "you were set in sandy soil, and stand, a mighty oak".

Many of the songs allude to a time in a treatment center and struggles with alcohol addiction. "17th Street Treatment Centre" is directly about that. I love the slight tinge of humor sprinkled in, something you see in _The Weakerthans_ as well. This song ends humorously with, "most of us probably not getting better, but not getting better together". The songs are short, but they don't rely on a repeating chorus to lengthen them, just a slow-paced melody and time in between to let each line sink in. It's a very honest and well-done album, tied together by theme and a few repeated references and a good mixture of melancholic and more upbeat songs.
